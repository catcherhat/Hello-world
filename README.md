                                        PORTFOLIO


Every content starts with an introduction.So here is an introduction about portfolio.We have heard about portfolio .What is portfolio? A portfolio is a collection of financial investments like stocks, bonds, commodities, cash, and cash equivalents, including closed-end funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). People generally believe that stocks, bonds, and cash comprise the core of a portfolio. Though this is often the case, it does not need to be the rule. A portfolio may contain a wide range of assets including real estate, art, and private investments. 
             
             
USAGE OF PORTFOLIO:
 
The sample portfolio is for an investor with a low tolerance for risk. In general, a conservative strategy tries to protect a portfolio's value by investing in lower-risk securities. In the example, you'll see that a full 50% is allocated to bonds, which might contain high-grade corporates and government bonds, including municipals (munis). The 20% stock allocation could comprise blue-chip or large-cap equities, and 30% of short-term investments might include cash, certificates of deposit (CDs), and high-yield savings accounts.
TYPES OF PORTFOLIO:
There can be as many different types of portfolios and portfolio strategies as there are investors and money managers. You also may choose to have multiple portfolios, whose contents could reflect a different strategy or investment scenario, structured for a different need.


A Hybrid Portfolio
The hybrid portfolio approach diversifies across asset classes. Building a hybrid portfolio requires venturing into other investments such as bonds, commodities, real estate, and even art. A hybrid portfolio would mix stocks and bonds in relatively fixed proportions. This is beneficial because historically equities and fixed-income securities have tended to correlate negatively with one another.

A Portfolio Investment
When you use a portfolio for investment purposes, you expect that the stock, bond, or another financial asset will earn a return or grow in value over time, or both. A portfolio investment may be either strategic—where you buy financial assets with the intention of holding onto those assets for a long time; or tactical—where you actively buy and sell the asset hoping to achieve short-term gains.

An Aggressive Portfolio
The underlying assets in an aggressive portfolio generally would assume great risks in search of great returns. Aggressive investors seek out companies that are in the early stages of their growth and have a unique value proposition. Most of them are not yet common household names.

A Defensive Portfolio
A portfolio that is defensive would tend to focus on consumer staples that are impervious to downturns. Defensive stocks do well in bad times as well as good times. No matter how bad the economy is at a given time, companies that make products that are essential to everyday life will survive.

An Income Portfolio
This type of portfolio makes money from dividend-paying stocks or other types of distributions to stakeholders. Some of the stocks in the income portfolio could also fit in the defensive portfolio, but here they are selected primarily for their high yields. An income portfolio should generate positive cash flow. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are examples of income-producing investments.

A Speculative Portfolio
A speculative portfolio is best for investors that have a high level of tolerance for risk. Speculative plays could include initial public offerings (IPOs) or stocks that are rumored to be takeover targets. Technology or health care firms in the process of developing a single breakthrough product also would fall into this category. 
Impact of Risk Tolerance on Portfolio Allocations
Although a financial advisor can create a generic portfolio model for an individual, an investor's risk tolerance should significantly reflect the portfolio's content.

For example, a conservative investor might favor a portfolio with large-cap value stocks, broad-based market index funds, investment-grade bonds, and a position in liquid, high-grade cash equivalents.

IMPACTS:

In contrast, a risk-tolerant investor might add some small-cap growth stocks to an aggressive, large-cap growth stock position, assume some high-yield bond exposure, and look to real estate, international, and alternative investment opportunities for their portfolio. In general, an investor should minimize exposure to securities or asset classes whose volatility makes them uncomfortable.
